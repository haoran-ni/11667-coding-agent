    "7_leetcode_hard": "Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:\n'.' Matches any single character.\n'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.\nThe matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s = 'aa', p = 'a'\nOutput: false\n\nExplanation: 'a' does not match the entire string 'aa'.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s = 'aa', p = 'a*'\nOutput: true\nExplanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes 'aa'.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = 'ab', p = '.*'\nOutput: true\nExplanation: '.*' means 'zero or more (*) of any character (.)'.",
