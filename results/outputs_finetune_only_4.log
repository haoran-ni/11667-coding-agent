2024-12-02 11:26:37,218 - INFO - Question: Write a function to calculate the average speed of an object given two pairs of its position and time in a one dimensional world, for example, (0, 1) and (1, 2) result in an average speed of 1. What is the average speed if it is on position 1.1 at time 0.5 and on position 2.5 at time 1.0?
